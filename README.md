# JS Calculator

This is my very own calculator app — part of my JavaScript learning journey during **Week 5** of a 9-week web development program.

The original project was a simple number calculator, but I had some fun and added extra features like memory functions and more interactive buttons. Explore, test it out, and feel free to be impressed!

**Note:** Although the calculator was built in **Week 5**, it remains inside the `JS Learning` folder in GitHub because it connects directly to the JavaScript lessons covered in Week 4.

## Features I Added

- **Memory buttons**: `MC`, `MR`, `M-`, `M+`
- **ON/OFF button** to simulate a real device  
  → When it's **off**, the screen shows `"OFF"` and buttons are disabled  
  → When it's **on**, the screen shows `"0"` and the calculator functions normally
- **Percentage button** (`%`)
- **Square root function** (`√`)
- **Plus-minus toggle** (`±`)
- **Decimal point** support (`.`)
- All the basics are still here: `0–9`, `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`, `=`, and `AC`

## What I Learned

Enhancing an existing calculator challenged me in new ways:

- Integrating new buttons meant figuring out how to expand the layout without breaking the existing structure
- I had to build **ON/OFF logic** using `if/else` statements
- Researched how JavaScript handles:
  - `Math.sqrt()`
  - Toggling between positive and negative numbers
  - Calculating percentages
- Learned the value of **clean layout** and positioning (I tried — and failed — to recreate a Casio pocket-style calculator)
- Most importantly: too many tweaks without a plan can break a working app — I learned to stick with what works!

## Background

Built while following a tutorial from **IT Varsity**, but all extra features, logic, and styling were added through experimentation and curiosity.
