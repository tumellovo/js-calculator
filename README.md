# JS Calculator

This is my very own calculator app - part of my JavaScript learning journey during Week 4 of a 9-week wen development program.

The original project was a simple number calculator, but I had some fun and added **extra features** like memory functions and more interactive buttons. Explore, testit out, and feel free to be impressed!

## Live Demo

## Features I Added

- Memory buttons: `MC`, `MR`, `M-`, `M+`
- `ON/OFF` button to simulate a real device (When it is off, the word OFF is written on the screen and the buttons do not work. When it is on, the number 0 shows that it is on and functioning.)
- Percentage button (`%`)
- Square root function (``)
- Plus-minus toggle (``)
- Decimal point support (`.`)

All the basics are still here: `0-9`, `+`, `-`, ``, ``, `=`, and `AC`.
