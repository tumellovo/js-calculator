# JS Calculator

This is my very own calculator app - part of my JavaScript learning journey during Week 4 of a 9-week wen development program.

The original project was a simple number calculator, but I had some fun and added **extra features** like memory functions and more interactive buttons. Explore, testit out, and feel free to be impressed!

## Live Demo

[Open Calculator](https://tumellovo.github.io/js-calculator/)

## Features I Added

- Memory buttons: `MC`, `MR`, `M-`, `M+`
- `ON/OFF` button to simulate a real device (When it is off, the word OFF is written on the screen and the buttons do not work. When it is on, the number 0 shows that it is on and functioning.) 
- Percentage button (`%`)
- Square root function (`√`)
- Plus-minus toggle (`±`)
- Decimal point support (`.`)

All the basics are still here: `0-9`, `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `=`, and `AC`.

## What I Learned

Enhancing an existing calculator challenged me in new ways:

- **Integrating new buttons** meant figuring out how to expand the layout without breaking existing code
- **Logic building**: I had to dive into `if/else` statements work, especially for the ON/OFF toggle
- I researched how functions like `math.sqrt()`, plus-minus toggles, and percentage calculations are written in JavaScript
- Realised the importance of layout structure - tried (and failed) to recreate a Casio pocket-style look
- Learned that too many tweaks without a plan can break a working app, so I stuck with what worked

## Background

Built while following IT Varsity's tutorial, but all extra features and polish are my own experiments.
